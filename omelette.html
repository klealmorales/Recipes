        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a mushroom omelette recipe that I make pretty often. 
            It requires very few ingredients, it's easy to make, and 
            most importantly it's very delicious. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Oil or Butter</li>
            <li>Grated cheese</li>
            <li>Mushrooms (sliced)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up the pan and melt butter in the pan or add oil to the pan</li>
            <li>In a separate pan add 2 handfuls of mushrooms evenly placed in the pan, and let it cook</li>
            <li>Crack 3-4 eggs in a small bowl and whisk thoroughly</li>
            <li>Add a small amount of milk to the egg mix and whisk further until fully mixed</li>
            <li>Add the eggs to the pan and let it sit until there is a cooked layer underneath</li>
            <li>Fold the omelette half way, and add grated cheese inside</li>
            <li>Once the mushrooms are fully golden brown then add them on top of the cheese inside the omelette</li>
            <li>Fold the omelette once again until the mushrooms and the cheese are fully wrapped</li>
            <li>Let the omelette cook until you reach the desired consistency (runny vs well cooked)</li>
            <li>Carefully place the omelette in a plate, and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
